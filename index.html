            Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, AO (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (listen); pronounced [sət͡ʃin t̪eːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24
            April
            1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is regarded
            as
            one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both
            ODI
            and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs, respectively.[5] He also holds the record
            for
            receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6]

            Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against
            Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
            internationally for over 24 years.[7] In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the
            second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all
            time, behind Viv Richards.[8] The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the
            joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian
            team
            that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[9] He had
            previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 World Cup.
            <br><br><br>
            Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel
            Ratna
            Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008).[10][11] After Tendulkar played his
            last
            match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat
            Ratna,
            India's highest civilian award.[12][13] He was the first sportsperson to receive the reward, and as of
            2021,
            he is the youngest recipient and was the first sportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] In 2012,
            Tendulkar
            was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[16]

            In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential people in the world.[17]
            Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International
            Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.[18]

            Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012,[19][20] he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013
            after
            playing his 200th Test match.[21] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring
            34,357 runs.[22] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th
            anniversary
            of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist batsman of the post–World War II era,
            along
            with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team.[23] In 2019, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall
            of
            Fame.[24]
            <br><br><br>
            Early years
            Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[25][26] to a Rajapur
            Saraswat
            Brahmin[better source needed] Maharastrian family.[27][28] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a
            Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[29] <img
                src="image/3.jpg" id="img3">
            Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman.[30] Tendulkar has
            three
            older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were his father's
            children
            by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[31][32] His brother Ajit played in
            Bombay's
            Kanga Cricket League.[33]

            Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East).
            As
            a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new children in his
            school.[34]

            As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. He particularly idolised American
            player
            John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time,
            Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands, and carried a tennis racquet with him as
            a
            sign of his love for tennis.[35][36][37]

            To help curb his bullying tendencies, his elder brother Ajit introduced Tendulkar to cricket in 1984.
            Ajit
            introduced him to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park in Dadar. At their first meeting,
            Tendulkar did not play well. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach
            observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another
            chance
            at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Tendulkar, apparently unobserved, played
            much
            better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[38][better source needed]
            Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling[citation needed]
            to
            Sharadashram Vidyamandir School,[25] a school in Dadar that had produced many notable cricketers. He
            made
            his debut as a cricketer for Sharadashram in late 1984.[39] Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the
            Indian
            Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of
            Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours; if he
            became
            exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed
            Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar completed the session without getting dismissed, the coach
            would
            give him the coin. Tendulkar considers the 13 coins he won among his most prized possessions.[41] While
            he
            was training at Shivaji Park, he moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near the park.[39]
            <br><br><br>
            <img src="image/1.jpg" alt="">
            Besides school cricket, Tendulkar also played club cricket. In 1984, at age 11, he debuted in the Kanga
            Cricket League while playing the John Bright Cricket Club.[39][42] Beginning in 1988, he played for the
            Cricket Club of India.[42][43]

            In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a
            fast
            bowler, but the trainer, Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, was unimpressed and suggested that
            Tendulkar
            focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he was a substitute for Imran Khan's side in an
            exhibition match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman
            Sunil
            Gavaskar gave Tendulkar a pair of his own lightweight pads and told him to not get disheartened for not
            receiving the Bombay Cricket Association's Best Junior Cricketer Award. Of this experience, Tendulkar
            later
            said, "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me".[46][47] Tendulkar served as a ball boy in
            the
            1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49]

            In 1988, while playing for Sharadashram, Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli batted in an unbroken 664-run
            partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School. Tendulkar scored
            326
            (not out) in that match and scored over 1,000 runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership
            in
            any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two junior cricketers in Hyderabad, India.[51]

            International career
            Early tours
            Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late
            1989,[65] after one first class season.[66] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in
            selecting
            Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as
            they
            did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his
            career.[citation needed]

            Tendulkar was the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days, and
            also
            the youngest player to debut for India in ODI at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[67][68] Tendulkar
            made
            his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He scored 15
            runs,
            being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match. He was noted for how he handled
            numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[69] In the fourth and final Test
            match
            in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and
            continued to bat even as he his nose gushed blood.[70] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in
            parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he
            scored 27 runs bowled by leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[71] This was later called "one of the best innings I
            have
            seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[72] In all, Tendulkar scored 215 runs at an
            average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day
            International (ODI) he played.[73][74]

            The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in
            Tests.[75] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two ODI games he played, and scored 36 in the
            other.[76] On a 1990 tour to England, on 14 August, he became the second-youngest cricketer to score a
            Test
            century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester.[70] Wisden described
            his
            innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote, "He looked the embodiment of
            India's
            famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire
            of
            strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back
            foot.
            Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the
            English
            pacemen".[77]
            <br><br><br>
            <img src="image/2.jpg" alt="">
            Tendulkar's reputation grew during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup.
            During the tour, he scored an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman
            to
            score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth
            against a pace attack from Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid, and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan
            Border at
            the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[78]

            Rise through the ranks
            1994–1996: ODI matches
            Tendulkar opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls.[79]
            He
            scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[80][81] He
            competed in 78 ODIs before scoring his first century.[citation needed]


            Tendulkar waits at the bowler's end.
            Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two
            centuries.[82] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri
            Lanka.[citation
            needed] Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse[citation needed] and the match referee, Clive Lloyd,
            awarded
            Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[83]

            After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin
            was
            going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record
            partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about
            whether
            he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently
            unleashed
            24 runs off one over.[84] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of
            300
            runs for the first time in an ODI.[85]

            1998: Australian competition
            Tendulkar scored 143 (131) runs in Sharjah against the Australian team in the 1998 Coca-Cola cup,
            including
            5 sixes in an inning against Shane Warne, Damien Fleming and Michael Kasprowicz. The inning is known as
            the
            "Desert Storm" because it was interrupted by a sand storm. In 2020, a poll from the ICC declared it
            Tendulkar's best ODI inning.[86]

            In early 1998, while playing in an Australian tour of India, Tendulkar scored three consecutive
            centuries.
            The focus of the tour was the clash between Tendulkar and spinner Shane Warne, both at the peak of their
            careers.[87] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman
            Sivaramakrishnan.[88] In their tour opener, Australia faced Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a
            three-day
            first class match.[89] Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 204 runs as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16
            overs
            and Australia lost the match within three days.[90][91] He also had a role with the ball in the
            five-match
            ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs
            to
            win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India,
            taking
            the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10
            overs.[92] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a
            Triangular
            cricket tournament in Sharjah—the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in
            the
            finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[93]
            Following
            the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[94]<br><br><br>

            Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the
            semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[95]

            1999: Asian Test Championship, Test matches, and the World Cup
            The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan,
            and
            Sri Lanka.[96] Around 100,000 attended the first four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old
            record
            for aggregate Test attendance record.[97] In the first match, between India and Pakistan at Eden
            Gardens,
            Tendulkar was dismissed from the match after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. The crowd
            reacted
            by throwing objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after
            Tendulkar
            and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was
            finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[98] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second
            Test
            and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[99] India did not progress to the final, which was won
            by
            Pakistan, and refused to participate in the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship due to increasing political
            tensions between India and Pakistan.[100]<br><br><br>

            In a Test match against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Tendulkar scored
            136
            runs; India lost the match by 12 runs.[101]

            Tendulkar's father, Ramesh Tendulkar, died during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to
            India
            to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[102] Tendulkar returned
            to
            the World Cup, scoring a century (140 not out of 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in
            Bristol.

            Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. Tendulkar became
            captain in 1996, but by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Discussing Tendulkar's first term as
            captain,
            Azharuddin was credited with saying, "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!" (Hindi: "Nahin
            jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!")[106][107]

            Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where
            the
            visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly-crowned world champions.[when?][108] Tendulkar won the player of
            the
            series award,[108] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[109] After another Test series
            defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly
            took
            over as captain in 2000.[110][111]

            Further information: Mohammed Azharuddin and South Africa cricket match fixing
            See also: Chandrachud Commission
            In 2000, members of the South African national team attempted to fix matches during their visit to
            India.
            After the incident, Tendulkar and three other senior cricketers worked to ensure that players "whose
            performance and conduct was dubious were never picked for the Indian squad again".[112]<br><br><br>

            Role in 2007 captaincy change
            During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy
            became known. Then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sharad Pawar offered the
            captaincy
            to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Pawar later revealed this conversation,
            crediting Tendulkar for suggesting Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[113] <img
                src="image/4.jpg" alt="">

            Continued rise
            2001–2002: Mike Denness incident, Kolkata Test, and breaking Bradman's record
            During India's 2001 tour of South Africa, in the second Test match, referee Mike Denness fined four
            Indian
            players for excessive appealing, and fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his
            team.[114] Denness suspended Tendulkar from one match for alleged ball tampering. Television cameras
            captured images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket
            ball.[115][116] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[117]
            and
            led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status
            of
            the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[118] The charges against Tendulkar
            triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[119]

            On the final day of the Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001, Tendulkar took three wickets, including
            the
            key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. His three
            wickets haul helped India win the match.[120] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his
            100th
            wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the
            Fatorda
            Stadium in Goa.[121]

            In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the
            second
            Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his
            93rd
            Test match, to equal Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds. He was gifted a Ferrari 360 Modena by
            Fiat
            through Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[122][123][124]

            Then, in an unprecedented sequence, he scored just 0, 0, 8, and 0 in the next four innings.[125] He
            returned
            to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[126] In
            this
            period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Tendulkar scored his 30th Test century
            to
            surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[127][128]<br><br><br>

            2003: Cricket World Cup
            Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[129] helping India reach the final.
            While Australia won, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[130][131]

            He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New
            Zealand and Australia.[132][133] As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew
            Hayden,
            in the tri-series final.[134]

            2003–2004: tour of Australia
            The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of
            the
            series, scoring 241 not out from 436 balls with 33 fours at a strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting
            India
            in a virtually unbeatable position. He spent 613 minutes at the crease during the innings. He followed
            this
            up with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[135] Prior to this Test match, he had had an
            unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation
            needed] It
            was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.00 and just one
            fifty.[136]

            Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain
            Rahul
            Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had
            passed the landmark in Tests.[137] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had
            taken him by surprise.[138] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad
            taste.[139][140] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed
            internally
            and put to rest.[141]

            A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year,
            coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[142][143] He played a part
            in
            India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[144]

            Performance dip
            2005–2006: dry spell
            On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against
            the
            Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test
            century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[145] Tendulkar scored
            his
            39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[146] He followed with a 42 in the
            second
            One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[147] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming
            conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[148] On 19 March 2006, after
            being
            dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground,
            Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd.[149] Tendulkar ended the
            three-Test
            series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions
            about his longevity.[citation needed]<br><br><br>

            <img src="image/5.jpg" alt="">
            Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his
            comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who
            believed
            that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[150] Though he scored 141 not out,
            West
            Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[151]

            2007 Cricket World Cup
            Further information: India at the Cricket World Cup § India at the 2007 World Cup
            During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian coach Greg
            Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while Tendulkar
            felt
            that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[152]
            Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare
            show of
            emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever
            suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket
            in
            India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[153]
            Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and
            that he
            and Tendulkar were on good terms.[152]

            At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a
            dismal
            campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57
            not
            out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[154][155][156] As a result, former Australian captain Ian
            Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[157]

            After the loss against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Tendulkar suffered depression and thought to retire
            from
            cricket, but Viv Richards and Ajit Tendulkar stopped him. According to Tendulkar, 23 March 2007, the
            loss
            against Bangladesh is one of the worst days of his cricketing career.[158]

            In 2007, in a Test series during India's tour of Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and
            was
            chosen as the Man of the Series.[159] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the
            Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs
            in
            ODIs.[160] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[161][162]


            Tendulkar, upon reaching his 38th Test century against Australia in the 2nd Test at the SCG in 2008,
            where
            he finished not out on 154
            On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to
            complete
            11,000 Test runs.[163] In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run
            scorer from India[164] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007
            Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[165]

            Tendulkar was dismissed five times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some
            to
            suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[166] Tendulkar has
            got
            out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[167] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he
            was
            caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[168] and in the
            fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a
            delivery
            from Gul on to his stumps.[169]<br><br><br>

            In 2008 India's tour of Australia, at a Sydney Test match, Australian Andrew Symonds accused Indian
            Harbhajan Singh of using racist terminology by calling him a monkey. This matter was dubbed "Monkeygate"
            by
            the media.[170] Singh was suspended by the match ICC referee after hearing. Sachin Tendulkar was
            standing on
            non-striker's end, at that moment, when Symonds claimed racist comments happened. In the hearing,
            Tendulkar
            said to the ICC match referee Mike Procter, that he could not say what exactly Singh said to Symonds,
            but in
            the next hearing, Tendulkar changed his stance and said that Symonds had not said "monkey" but "Teri Maa

            citation needed] The matter became big in following days and nearly led to the cancellation of this
            tour.[171] Referee suspended Singh for 3 Test but after appeal and Tendulkar's statement in hearing the
            suspension was overturned. Andrew Symonds later said in Monkeygate- Ten years on, a documentary that was
            based on this matter, "When I began to play for Mumbai Indians, IPL franchise, once Harbhajan Singh came
            to
            me and apologised." Symonds said in the documentary, "We go to a very wealthy man's place for a
            barbecue,
            drinks, and dinner one night, and the whole team's there, and he had guests there, and Harbhajan said
            'mate,
            can I speak to you for a minute out in the garden out the front?' He goes, 'look, I've got to say sorry
            to
            you for what I did to you in Sydney. I apologise."[172][173][174][175][176][171] The Herald Sun quoted,
            Tendulkar is still not "forgiven" by some Aussie players for changing his account on Monkeygate, dubbed
            Tendulkar as Indian "demigod".[177][178]
            <img src="image/Tendulkar_shot.JPG">
            In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run
            scorer
            with "493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[179] Tendulkar scored
            62
            runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy
            337-run
            win for Australia.[180] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten
            154,
            even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century
            overall,
            earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[181][182] In the
            third
            Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Tendulkar was instrumental in India's first innings score of
            330,
            scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's
            run
            of 16 consecutive wins.[183] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored
            153
            in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126-run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket
            to
            lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[184] He secured the Man of the Match award.[185]

            In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia,
            Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[186] He achieved this feat against
            Sri
            Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and
            32.[187] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came
            back
            strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54
            balls.[188] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first
            final,[189]
            and 91 runs in the second final.[190] Both the knocks were nominated to be the ODI Batting Performance
            of
            the year by ESPNCricinfo.[191]<br><br><br>

            Home series against South Africa
            South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck
            in
            his only innings of the series;[192] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced
            not
            only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia
            Cup,
            and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[193]

            Sri Lanka series
            Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past
            Brian
            Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs.
            India
            lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three
            matches.[194]

            Return to form and breaking Brian Lara's record
            In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[195] However,
            during
            the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first
            Test[196] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most Test
            runs
            held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000-run mark when he was on 61.[197][198] He described the
            achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[199] He made a
            fifty
            in the third Test[200] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the
            Border-Gavaskar
            Trophy.[201]

            ODI and Test series against England
            Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due
            to
            an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[202] and 50 in the fifth,[203] before the series was called
            off
            due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[204][205]

            England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally
            planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[204][205] Chasing 387
            for
            victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket
            partnership
            with Yuvraj Singh.[206] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first
            which resulted in a win.[207] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror
            attacks.[208]
            The knock was nominated to be one of the Test Batting Performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo.[209]
            Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series
            1–0.[210]

            2009–2010
            See also: List of highest individual scores in ODIs
            In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to
            the
            security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7
            in
            the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the
            remaining
            two matches.[211]

            India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs.
            In
            the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to
            end
            his innings. India made 392, won the match[212] and eventually won the series 3–1.[213] Tendulkar made
            160
            in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[214] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[215]
            and
            62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two
            wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[216][217]<br><br><br>
            <img src="image/7.jpg" alt="">
            Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[218] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri
            Series
            between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[219] and 27[220] in the
            league
            matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[221] This was
            Tendulkar's
            sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such
            finals.[222]

            Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against
            Pakistan as
            India lost.[223] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[224] and he was out with a
            stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[225]

            Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40
            in
            the first four games.[226] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in
            50
            overs.[227] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would<img src="image/8.jpg" id="img8">
            steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint
            McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18
            balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three
            runs.[228][229]
            During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[229][230] and
            achieved
            his personal best against Australia,[231] as well as the third-highest score in a defeat.[232] The knock
            was
            voted as the Best ODI Batting Performance of 2009 by ESPNCricinfo.[233]

            In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in
            the
            first four matches,[234] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and
            potentially
            dangerous.[235] India won the series 3–1.[236] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out
            in
            the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests, respectively, as India
            clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[237]

            Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test
            series.[238] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the
            Tests.[239][240]

            In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[241] He then
            scored
            106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his
            fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[242][243] In the
            second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first
            batsman
            to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by
            Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
